### Code for the experiment from my paper "Exploring a novel visual illusion and the effect of perceptual grouping on motion tracking". 

## Abstract

In this study, we characterise a novel visual illusion called the Curving Path illusion. We investigate whether it exists and establish a link to the so far under-examined Tusi illusion. 
Based on this link, we hypothesised that the Curving Path illusion occurs because dots are processed as a single object undergoing complex motion. 
This explanation was investigated by manipulating the degree to which the dots were expected to be grouped together. 
An original task for object tracking was used where participants indicate the perceived and predicted trajectory of a dot after seeing it move through an aperture. 
We find that in all conditions where more than one dot was presented, dots were perceived to be moving on illusory curved trajectories even though they were veridically moving on a straight path. 
In the majority of trials, the predicted trajectory curved in the same direction as the arc formed by the dots when they were leaving the aperture. 
While the strength of the illusion as measured by the curvature of the perceived trajectory did not vary with the manipulated variables, this could speak to the robustness of the effect. 
The primary contribution of this study is in presenting the Curving Path illusion and restricting the search space of underlying mechanisms for future investigations.
